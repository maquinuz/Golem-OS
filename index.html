<p>I started this idea quite some time ago before 2015 and that was basically a bunch of handy python scripts, then along my research along the time I came to know Dietpi, which is a great work ! It is so nice all those shell scripts all aligned and delivering a nice working environment.</p>

<p>What happened was, That it was right the next phase my working experiments. Automate a nice OS around this "Python Ecosystem" and package that into a Nice Customized OS, Designed for speed and joyful experience with people.</p>

<p>Whit all that DIY knowledge and some python experience. Along some breadboard and iron solder leds and resistors and buttons. Making python programs to work with electronics. I needed a base OS to support this idea.</p>

<p>The Golem OS project aims to be or feel the gap of delivering solutions into products. 
By filling this 'gap' developers around the globe will now be able to deliver 
a broad range of software application solutions and 'include' that into a Raspberry Pi distro
that will support it and allow you to easily customize and deliver a full product experience.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
