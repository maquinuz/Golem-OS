It is so nice all those shell scripts all aligned and delivering a nice working environment.\r\n\r\nWhat happened was, That it was right the next phase my working experiments. Automate a nice OS around this \"Python Ecosystem\" and package that into a Nice Customized OS, Designed for speed and joyful experience with people.\r\n\r\nWhit all that DIY knowledge and some python experience. Along some breadboard and iron solder leds and resistors and buttons. Making python programs to work with electronics. I needed a base OS to support this idea.\r\n\r\nThe Golem OS project aims to be or feel the gap of delivering solutions into products. \r\nBy filling this 'gap' developers around the globe will now be able to deliver \r\na broad range of software application solutions and 'include' that into a Raspberry Pi distro\r\nthat will support it and allow you to easily customize and deliver a full product experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### More to come \r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
